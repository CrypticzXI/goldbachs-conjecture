The following code requires you to enter a number, then the code will automatically loop
through every number till it either equals your value or finds a value that breaks Goldbach's Conjecture.

The following code uses CPU processing power to loop through numbers.

# If you do not know about Goldbach's Conjecture please read below.

The following text will be quoted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture

"Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics.
It states that every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers."

"The conjecture has been shown to hold for all integers less than 4 Ã— 10^18, but remains unproven despite considerable effort."
4 x 10^18 = 4,000,000,000,000,000,000


Feel free to run the code, It's pretty simple. Download and double click the .py file, There are no dependencies so it should run perfectly.
Faster your CPU the faster it crunches numbers.
